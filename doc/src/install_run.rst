Download, Install and Run FEMhub
================================
You can run download and install FEMhub easily on your local desktop.
Please follow the instructions below. If you do not want to download or
install anything you can use our `FEMhub Online Numerical Methods Laboratory <http://lab.femhub.org/>`_.

Binary
------

You can view a list of the binaries of all versions `here <http://femhub.org/pub/>`_. From there you can download the
version you want.

If you downloaded a binary, you do not need to do anything, just extract it and
you are reday to go. For example, in ubuntu machine you will do the following:
::
    \$ wget http://femhub.org/pub/femhub-0.9.10.beta2-ubuntu64.tar.gz
    \$ tar xzf femhub-0.9.10.beta2-ubuntu64.tar.gz

Then follow the instructions on running FEMhub below.

Building from Sources
---------------------
You can get the tarball of sources `here <http://femhub.org/pub/>`_. The most
recent stable version is femhub-0.9.9 but you can try our latest beta version
which contains the new version of the online lab.
Please follow the instructions below to build from sources for different operating systems.

Linux Distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To download the sources you can use the following command in Ubuntu Linux:
::

  \$ wget http://femhub.org/pub/femhub-0.9.10.beta1.tar

After you download the sources, please read below on how to build FEMhub and work around common issues:

1. Make sure you have the dependencies and 2GB free disk space.
Install these using your package manager
::
  gcc, g++, make, gfortran, m4, perl, and tar.

For example in Ubuntu Linux you can do
::
  \$ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran make m4 perl tar

2. Extract the tarball:
::

  \$ tar xf femhub-0.9.10.beta1.tar

3. cd into the  femhub directory and type make:
::
      \$ cd femhub-0.9.10.beta1
      \$ make

Note: for installing mesa (and vtk too), you need the X11 header files
currently, so you also need to do::

    \$ sudo apt-get install libx11-dev x11proto-xext-dev libxext-dev libxt-dev


Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~
You can use the following command to download the tarball of sources:
::
  \$ curl -O http://femhub.org/pub/femhub-0.9.9.tar


1. Make sure you have the dependencies and 2GB free disk space.

Google "download Xcode". You have to register as Apple Developer (yes, you gotta believe). Do not pay any fees, they may offer you access to their newest updates for $99 per year or more. Xcode contains make and other things that are required to build FEMhub. Then download, unpack, and build FEMhub:

WARNING: If "gcc -v" outputs 4.0.0, you  *must* upgrade XCode (free from Apple), since that version of GCC is very broken.

2. Extract the tarball:
::

  \$ tar xf femhub-0.9.9-*.tar

3. cd into the femhub directory and type make:
::
  \$ cd femhub-0.9.9
  \$ make


Microsoft Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have the dependencies and 2GB free disk space.

Download and install the Linux emulator Cygwin from `here <http://www.cygwin.com/>`_ (the small icon in the top-right corner). While running setup.exe, you need to install
::
  cmake, gcc4, gfortran, git, gitk, libX11-devel, libXext-devel,
  libXt-devel, libXt, libXext, make, m4, openssl-devel, perl,
  python, wget, xextproto.

This is a bit tedious but you have to survive it. We would like to create one package containing all of those, to facilitate the download - any help is welcome. For some packages, there will be more choices - follow the magical word GNU. Then download, unpack, and build FEMhub as in Linux:
::
  \$ wget http://femhub.org/pub/femhub-0.9.9.tar
  \$ tar -xf femhub-0.9.9.tar
  \$ cd femhub-0.9.9
  \$ make


Other Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may try building in other operating systems and please let us know how it goes.
NOTE: On some operating systems it might be necessary to install
gas/as, gld/ld, gnm/nm, but on most these are automatically
installed when you install the programs listed above.  Only OS X
>= 10.4.x and certain Linux distributions are 100% supported.
See below for a complete list.

After Building Starts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the building process starts, wait between 37 minutes to 1.5 hour depending upon the speed of your computer. Everything is automatic and non-interactive.

If you encounter problems, let us know through the FEMhub mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/femhub

If you want, you can also download a binary from `here <http://femhub.org/pub/>`_, however, if it doesn't work for you, compile from source, that should always work.

Git Repository
--------------

If you use git, you can download FEMhub and compile by following these instructions:
::
    \$ git clone http://git.hpfem.org/git/femhub.git
    \$ cd femhub
    \$ ./femhub -d
    \$ make

Running FEMhub
---------------

Go the femhub top directory, and just execute
::

 ./femhub

from the command line, and type lab() after that.
::
    \$ ./femhub
